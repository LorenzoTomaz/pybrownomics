# PyBrownomics

PyBrownomics is a package with different tokenomics simulation models.

Models:

- pybrownomics/control:

  - Implements the concepts outlined in the research article [A Control Theoretic Approach to Infrastructure-Centric Blockchain Tokenomics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12881.pdf) by Oguzhan Akcin, Robert P. Streit, Benjamin Oommen, Sriram Vishwanath, and Sandeep Chinchali.
  - **This module was designed and implemented by the Brownomics team during the [superhack](https://ethglobal.com/events/superhack) ETHGlobal hackathon.**

- pybrownomics/brown:
  - Utility Token Price Simulator is a simulator that simulates general token prices when setting parameters.
    It is implemented based on the theory of [Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/WP_2018-49.pdf).
  - **This module was designed and implemented by [melonattacker](https://github.com/melonattacker) and the original source code comes from [utility-token-price-simulator](https://github.com/melonattacker/utility-token-price-simulator).**
